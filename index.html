        An <strong>escape room</strong>, also known as <em>escape game</em> or
        <em>puzzle room</em>, is a game in which a team of players discover
        clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order
        to accomplish a specific goal in a limited amount of time. The goal is
        often to escape from the site of the game. Most escape games are
        cooperative but competitive variants exist. <br /><br />

        Escape rooms test the
        <strong>problem-solving</strong>,
        <strong>lateral thinking</strong> ("thinking outside the box"), and
        <strong>teamwork skills</strong>
        of participants by providing a variety of puzzles and challenges that
        unlock access to new items or areas in the game when solved. Escape room
        puzzles include <em>word, number, and symbol puzzles</em> such as
        substitution cyphers, riddles, crosswords, Sudoku, word search, and
        mathematics; puzzles involving <em>physical objects</em> such as jigsaw
        puzzles, matchstick puzzles, and chess; and physical activity such as
        searching for a hidden physical object, assembling an object, navigating
        mazes, or undoing a rope knot.
